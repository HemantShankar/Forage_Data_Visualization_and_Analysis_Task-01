# Forage_Data_Visualization_and_Analysis_Task-01
It is a task that i completed while i was working on forage platform. They had two taks that were going to give me the real life experience of data analysis and visualization at
Tata IQ. In this task, I was given a dataset of a retail store and i had to make 6-8 observations out of it. The observation needed to be subjected towards the growth and expansion of the retail store.
So, I performed data cleaning, Feature Engineering and EDA on the dataset and made 8 observations out of it.
